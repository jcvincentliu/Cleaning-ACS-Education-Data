# Cleaning-ACS-Education-Data

The repository contained the Rmd file (`cleaning.Rmd`) I used to wrangle the 2015-2019 American Community Survey data, which was part of my Teaching Assistant duty for the *Data and Programming with R 1* class. Packages used include `tidyverse`, `forcats`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `sf`.

The data is accessed from the [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/) database hosted by the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
