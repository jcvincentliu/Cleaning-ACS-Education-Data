# Cleaning-ACS-Education-Data

I wrangled the 2015-2019 American Community Survey data in cleaning.Rmd, which was developed as part of my Teaching Assistant duty for the *Data and Programming with R 1* class. Packages used include (`tidyverse`) `forcats`, `ggplot`, `dplyr`, and `sf`.

The data is accessed from the [IPUMS](https://www.ipums.org/) database hosted by the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.
